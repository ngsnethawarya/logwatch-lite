# logwatch-lite

This project is a small learning exercise focused on understanding how Linux authentication logs
can be analyzed to identify basic indicators of suspicious activity.

The goal is not to replace full SIEM solutions, but to practice log parsing, data analysis,
and clean Python project structure.

## Features
- Parses Linux auth logs
- Detects repeated failed login attempts
- Summarizes activity by IP and user
- Designed for educational use

## Status
Work in progress.
